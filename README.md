# find-me-dinner

Find Me Dinner looks to fix the problem of "What do I want to eat?" Life is busy and moves fast, so we want to easy that process. With so many choices on what to eat, how can we make that easier?

The user selects the type of food they are in the mood for and enters their zip code. Find Me Dinner will get 3 options near the user to make the decision making process easier.

We used HTML, CSS, Javascript to create the project. We also used Bootstrap CDN for certain aspects of the design as well.
